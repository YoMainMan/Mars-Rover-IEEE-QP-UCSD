In order to use this code the robot requiries the use of at least 2 motors to control to driving of
the robot, and not a requirement, a front steering mechanism which can be replaced by less
frictionless ball point at the bottom. A lot of power may need to be supplied to have better
movement

An improvement to the buttons is to include more than one motor for better power to the sample picker.

Mars Rover Controls are uploaded directly to ESP32 using Arduino IDE

Mars Rover Controls are able to be controlled on any device, preferred phone, but not on the same
device as an LLM

Controls look like this, different on IOS:

To start LLM, you need an API key to connect to Grok and take screenshots from the WiFi camera
and upload it manually, while copying the path to exImg.png. API key not provided as that is a 
security risk to my partner.

LLM ran on a separate device and camera is viewed from same device
